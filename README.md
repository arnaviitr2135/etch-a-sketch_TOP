# Etch-a-Sketch Grid Drawing

This is a simple browser-based drawing grid project inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. It allows users to draw by hovering or clicking over grid squares, and even resize the grid dynamically.

## 🚀 Features

- 16×16 default grid of square divs
- Hover or click on squares to color them
- Button to resize the grid (up to 100×100)
- Grid dynamically scales within a fixed area (960×960 pixels)
- Flexbox layout for responsive design
- Clean, minimal UI

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling)

## 🎨 How It Works

1. The page loads with a 16×16 grid of square divs.
2. Hovering or clicking on a square changes its background color.
3. Clicking the “Resize Grid” button prompts the user to enter a new grid size (e.g. 64 → 64×64).
4. The grid resizes while staying within a 960px-wide container.
5. Optional enhancements like random colors or darkening on repeat hovers can be added.
